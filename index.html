  <h2>How the Congressional Review Act Works</h2>

<section class="container">
  <h2>Why it's a powerful way to save net neutrality:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Review_Act">Congressional Review Act</a> (CRA) allows our elected officials in Congress to overrule undemocratic decisions made by unelected federal agencies like the FCC.</li>
      <li>Unlike a normal bill, a "Resolution of Disapproval" under the CRA only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House. No filibuster.</li>
      <li>More importantly, House and Senate leaders cannot block a CRA with majority support from coming to the floor.</li>
      <li>Net neutrality is <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/364528-poll-83-percent-of-voters-support-keeping-fccs-net-neutrality-rules">not a partisan issue</a>. But, the telecom industry has spent millions trying to paint it as one so they can get the Republican Party to help end the rules altogether. Their plan started working recently with a few lawmakers giving support to former Verizon lawyer and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to kill off 22 years of net neutrality rules and precedent.</li>
<li>With 83% of people from both sides of the aisle in support of net neutrality and after millions of people have called on Congress to protect the rules, Republican members of Congress are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16772792/coffman-ajit-pai-net-neutrality-letter">changing their positions.</a></li>
      <li>In the Senate, we may only need <em>one</em> more Republican to vote for the CRA to get it passed, given that Susan Collins (R-ME) <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2017/11/24/politics/collins-pingree-king-rip-plan-to-end-net-neutrality/">opposed the FCC plan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmphillipsdc/status/944000024274505728">signalled openness</a> to a CRA.</li>
      <li>In the House, we'll need about 20 Republicans to listen to their constituents and vote for the CRA. That's harder, but several Republican representatives have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/even-some-republican-congresspeople-oppose-full-net-neutrality-repeal/">already criticized</a> the FCC's vote, and given that more than <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/364528-poll-83-percent-of-voters-support-keeping-fccs-net-neutrality-rules">75% of Republican voters</a> support net neutrality, it's doable.</li>
    </ul>
